[I love Steven Universe, and not only because of this.](http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/14/8961119/what-a-childrens-show-can-teach-us-about-sex-and-healthy-relationships)

> This article mentions sexual assault and rape. It also includes spoilers for Steven Universe.
> 
> Steven Universe has never shied away from issues regarding sexuality, introducing topics such as unconventional family dynamics and gender fluidity into the lore and backstories of the characters since the beginning.
> 
> In the recent episode "Keeping it Together," which clocks in at a brief 11 minutes, we see a better discussion about healthy sexual relationships and the repercussions of forced mingling than in any show currently on TV.

It's definitely a weird show, and it takes some getting used to it. But it you're up for a quirky new animated series, you should try out Steven Universe.

Also: cutest lion ever.

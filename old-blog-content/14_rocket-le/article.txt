> *Rocket League*’s touch of zaniness allows it to focus on the bare essentials of the game: there are the players, a ball, and two goals. There are no stat games here. No managing players. No fluff. Just soccer…with turbo-powered RC cars, and it’s all the better and more accessible for that.

I've only had time to okay Rocket League for one or two matches over the weekend, but I can already tell that I'm hooked. Here's hoping I'll find some time and friendly co-players soon!

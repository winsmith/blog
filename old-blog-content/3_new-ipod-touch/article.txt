[Apple has just quietly updated the iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/), which now comes in five different colours. I love the blue. The only downside is that it's not the same colour as the Watch bands.

The screen size is that of the iPhone 5s, not that of the 6. That makes me think fall is probably going to bring a new 4" iPhone.

The new iPod Touch also features a better camera, the A8 System-on-a-Chip, and surprisingly, the M8 motion coprocessor.

[iMore point out](http://www.imore.com/apple-refreshes-ipod-nano-and-shuffle-brand-new-colors) that the iPod nano and iPod shuffle also get updates. However, they only seem to get the new pink and blue colour coatings, no new interiours.

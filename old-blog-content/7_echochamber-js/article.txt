[My new favourite JavaScript library](https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js) is a JS-based commenting system for your website. The trick? Using your browser's local database, it saves the comments locally instead of on your web server. Anything a user posts, only they *themselves* can see.

> When a user submits a comment, echochamber.js will save the comment to the user's LocalStorage, so when they return to the page, they can be confident that their voice is being heard, and feel _engaged_ with your very engaging content. It does not make any HTTP requests. Since LocalStorage is only local, you and your database need not be burdened with other people's opinions.

The idea for this seems to stem from the growing-ever-more-popupar idea that reading any internet comments is not worth your time, and [comments should in fact be moderated or downright disabled](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2015/04/21/dont-read-the-comments-comment-sections-are-our-own-fault/).

The author, JavaScript developer Tessa Thornton, seems to have the right idea, as the internet is trying very hard to prove the need for her software:

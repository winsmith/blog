[Well written and terrifically illustrated, here is Colin Campbell's series of articles on the history of Electronic Arts.](http://www.polygon.com/a/how-ea-lost-its-soul)

*Polygon*'s magazine-style issues really are amazing. The writing is spot-on and I just love the 8-bit-style illustrations. If you don't have a lot of time, at least click through the pages and look at the images.
